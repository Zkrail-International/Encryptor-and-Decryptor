# Encryptor-and-Decryptor

Just run the main file. Wherever you are running the python file from, is where the encryption output and decryption output files will end up.

This was just a project for my enjoyment, and this python project has no peer review, and cannot be relied on for security.



DEPENDENCIES:

base64 module & cryptography module
